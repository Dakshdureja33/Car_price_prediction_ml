ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Model

This project successfully builds a machine learning pipeline to predict car prices using relevant features.
EDA helped identify key factors influencing car prices, such as year, mileage, and brand.
Multiple models were evaluated, with Random Forest and XGBoost providing strong performance.
The pipeline achieves reliable accuracy, enabling informed pricing decisions.
The project structure is modular and can be easily extended with new data.
Future work can include deployment as a web app for user-friendly predictions.
Overall, this project demonstrates practical ML skills in a real-world use case.
